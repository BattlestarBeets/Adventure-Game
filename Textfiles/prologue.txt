It’s Friday night, you and your three friends are done with school for the evening but senioritis is hitting you hard. With your final semester coming to a close and stress of loans looming over your heads, Reese recommends hitting up this abandoned mansion that’s rumored to have been owned by an eccentric billionaire who found his wealth through his many breakthroughs in the medical field. People say he was a scientist who went mad after years of conducting peculiar experiments on himself on the grounds and that when he died he left his riches somewhere hidden on the property. The moment Mai heard that you could all pay off your last year of school, as well as her running equipment, with the ease she was in. Billy, the most go with the flow of the group, smoked himself into a stupor and said he’d go along with whatever the plan was. The four of you arrive at the mansion, now overgrown with shattered windows and fallen shutters. You and your friends have split up to search the premises. The goal at hand is to find your friends as well as get through the mansion and its mysteries to find the madman’s safe hidden somewhere in the mansion. But beware, many who have come in search of the doctor’s wealth were never to be seen again? Can you make it out?
