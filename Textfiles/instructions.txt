You are now at the entrance of the mansion. Behind you was the graveyard which you walked through to get here. To your left a heavy wooden door stands with a bronze knob. Another door lies straight ahead of you but this door is not as imposing as the previous. Aside from the grand double doors that you entered through, a final decorative swinging door can be seen to your right.
